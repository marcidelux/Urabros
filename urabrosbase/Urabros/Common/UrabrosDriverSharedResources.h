  * @brief   Currently this is not used, it can be implemented if very necessary.\n
  *          In older verison Urabros 1.0 it was used for sharing global variables between tasks and master.\n
  *          The new architectural choice was to not Allow this kind of communication. Use the queues, and statuses instead.
  *          And if two tasks has to communicate with each other use the inner queues.
